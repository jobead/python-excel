# python-excel
Interacts with Excel files using python

I wrote this code to assist with reverse engineering some excel files with very complicated SQL connections.

The functions are supposed to work on many excel files at once (that are in the same directory) so feel free to try on a whole directory, and the output files will list each filename immediately before the extracted information.

TODO:
- Add some features
- Add more features
- Add EVEN MORE features
